    {Present}   {Research Associate}{Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit}{UCL}
    {January 2019} { Scalability of perturbation based biologically plausible learning algorithms for deep neural networks.  
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item These high variance gradient estimates are very slow to converge. I came up with a hybrid perturbation algorithm which allowed us to empirically get a lower bound on performance of node perturbation
                        % \item Presented our work to various researchers
                      \end{itemize}

                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Worked on neural architecture search (NAS) with a Bayesian Optimization Hyperband search strategy for extreme low light image denoising                     
                        \item Extensive literature review on neural architecture search to understand the recent methods   
                        \item I came up with a novel way to combine NAS and compression strategies, which resulted in 8x lower latency model and initiated a collaboration with the Huawei Moscow team
                      \end{itemize}

                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Published an extensive literature survey on deep learning-based automated personality detection, with a focus on multimodal approaches
                        \item Initiated a collaboration with researchers in Iran University and achieved state-of-the-art results on the famous Essays personality dataset
                        \item Continued research remotely and went on to further collaborate with computational psychology researchers at Stanford to further extend the work
