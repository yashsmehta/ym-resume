Hi! I'm currently a research associate at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL, where I’m working on evaluating biologically plausible perturbation-based learning algorithms to train deep networks under the guidance of \href{https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wmqntyEAAAAJ&hl=en}{\textbf{Prof Peter Latham}} (Gatsby) and \href{https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=htPVdRMAAAAJ&hl=en}{\textbf{Tim Lillicrap}} (DeepMind). I have a good understanding of the recent advances in the field of deep learning and specifically, am quite excited about neural architecture search and autoML. In the past, I’ve also worked on deep learning-based personality detection from text with \href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ilSYpW0AAAAJ&hl=en}{\textbf{Prof Erik Cambria}} (NTU Singapore).
\\
I thoroughly enjoy coding and working on hard algorithmic problems.
