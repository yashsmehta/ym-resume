	\project
	{NAS4NLP}{Jan 2020}
	{Each of the layers of a LM encode different features of the input text and depending on certain tasks and data, certain layers can be more beneficial than others. We came up with a novel method to combine neural architecture search with the gumbel-softmax to find the best combination of these embeddings without external hand engineering.}

	\project
	{NodePert}{Jan 2019}
	{What algorithms drive goal directed learning in the brain? 
	We study theory and perform experiments to understand how perturbation methods scale with network depth and width. We also evaluate performance of perturbation methods on modern architectures and datasets.}
